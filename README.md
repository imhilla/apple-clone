# apple-clone 
In this project i cloned the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It wasn't a very complex site but it used background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that can be mimiced.

Here's the old version website https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/

Here's the screenshot

Here are some of the things i did
Created empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.
Created the navbar and achieved the aim of using background as a gradient 

Next, i embedded the background image and positioned it absolutely.
Later i filled all the other positons.
